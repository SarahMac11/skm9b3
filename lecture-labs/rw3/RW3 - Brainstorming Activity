# RW3: Brainstorming Activity

## Brainstorming
- Software system that analyzes open-source software metrics reflect:
    - How well collaboration is working on project
    - Health of the project for customers and streamlining business/engineer communication

### Requirements
(Practicality)(Priority)
- (1)(2) Metrics should be tracked with automated updates.
- (3)(3) Notifications should be relayed to people working on the project.
- (1)(2) Investors need a UI to visualize data.
- (2)(4) Developers need access to a database to store metrics data.
- Users:
    - (3)(4) Should be able to implement the API into any part of the system
    - (1)(2) Would like better visualizations of metrics
    - (3)(1) System needs multiple user endpoints (API) to access specific metrics for their respective roles
    - (1)(1) Users need version control implemented to track timestamps of commits, issues, pull requests, etc.
    
### Functional Requirements
- (1)(1) Customer can monitor commits/pulls/forks over time, average size of commits, etc.
- (2)(1) Customer can monitor developer interaction (how often are people talking)
- (1)(1) Customer can visit repositories to get metrics
- (4)(1) Customer can sort projects by comparing metrics to successful projects
- (4)(1) Customer can find and "rate" project similarity
- (2)(1) Customer have a UI system to display metrics in different ways

### System Requirements
- System needs a massive database system for developers.

Metrics are based on:
- How often commits are made
- Volume of commits
- Time elapsed between commits
- Number of people working on branches
- Tracking code reuse in other projects
