# Sarah McLaughlins' Thoughts on Ethics in Software Engineering


1. I think a major ethical considering that is already implemented in the EU, not yet in the USA, the GDRP, or some sort of data follow up and protection is very important. Many times users input personal information that needs to be followed up with, and through software engineering and security I think this is very important. 

2. Again, related to confidentiality, I think that the software and process that is implemented in order to deal with protected items, also needs to be protected, along with the other work done for any employer.

3. An important topic in ethics that should be followed surrounds intellectual property. Without permission ot use software legally, it is not fair to any other software engineer to just reuse code or process again.
